# Water surface fluctuations

You can apply effects like swell, agitation, deformation, and foam across the water surface.

You can add fluctuations such as swell, agitation, or ripples to the whole of a water surface based on texture channels with a Water Mask.

You can also add detailed visual effects to localized water areas with water decals, a type of shader graph nodes.
