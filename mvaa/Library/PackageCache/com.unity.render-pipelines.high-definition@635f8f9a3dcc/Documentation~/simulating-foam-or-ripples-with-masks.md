# Simulate foam or ripples with masks

A simulation mask defines areas of influence for specific water simulation effects, such as foam or ripples.

By using a simulation mask, you can restrict these effects to particular regions on the water surface, enabling localized interactions. 

For example, if you're simulating debris or objects affecting the water, a simulation mask will allow you to define where foam or other effects appear based on those interactions.

> [!NOTE]
> For backward compatibility, simulation masks are disabled by default.
